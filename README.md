## Install
If you don't have python installed, [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) it, install it and add it to the PATH.
After that you need *pypresence* in order to run the little script, open the command prompt and do `pip install pypresence`.
Then you just need to launch `fh4-rpc.py`. It will auto detect Forza Horizon 4 and start the rich presence when you launch the game.
